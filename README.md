# is452_final_project
These programs represent work I've done on my final project - the files should be run in Jupyter Notebook.

The code scrapes XML from a webpage containing data on major publications by University of Illinois library faculty, which can be found online at https://www.library.illinois.edu/lis/facpubs/. Then, using etree and counter functions, it extracts data about number of publications by each faculty, as well as the journals in which faculty most frequently publish. It then creates CSV output of the data points.
